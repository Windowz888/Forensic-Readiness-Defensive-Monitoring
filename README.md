# Forensic-Readiness-Defensive-Monitoring
Designing Defensive Architecture and Monitoring Attacks with SIEM
# Forensic Readiness & Defensive Monitoring (SIEM Lab)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focused on designing defensive architecture and analyzing simulated cyberattacks using SIEM monitoring. It demonstrates forensic readiness principles—ensuring systems are prepared to detect, preserve, and analyze evidence of attacks.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools
- Splunk (Log collection, dashboards, alerts)
- Windows Server Logs
- Apache Web Server Logs
- Defensive controls (Firewall, IDS/IPS)

## 🔑 Key Tasks
1. Designed forensic readiness solution for enterprise lab.  
2. Collected and ingested logs from Windows & Apache servers.  
3. Built dashboards to visualize suspicious behavior.  
4. Configured alerts for brute force logins, account deletions, and abnormal traffic.  
5. Analyzed attack simulations and proposed mitigations.  

## 📷 Proof of Concept
- Splunk dashboards highlighting attack spikes.  
- Alerts for unusual login activity and POST method anomalies.  
- PDF activity guides in `/guides/`.  

## 🎯 Skills Demonstrated
- Blue Team operations and SIEM monitoring  
- Incident detection and forensic readiness  
- Log analysis and alert configuration
